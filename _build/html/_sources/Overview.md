# Overview

## Acknowledgements 

These lecture notes are adapted from those given to me by colleagues who
have previously taught this course in particular Rhoda Hawkins and Nigel Clarke have been incredibly helpful in sharing their materials with us.

## Your input 

Please report any mistakes you find and feed back any comments you have
to us so we can improve these notes. Thanks!

## Recommended reading

Published textbooks will have been proof-read more thoroughly than
lecture notes typed by lecturers, including these. We encourage you to
look at text books in addition to these notes. In particular I
recommend:

-   Martin and Shaw "Mathematics for Physicists"

-   Boas "Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences"

There are also some excellent maths resources on YouTube. In particular
We recommend the series by 3blue1brown on \"Essence of linear algebra\"
for developing an intuitive feeling for the vectors and matrices part of
the course.

## Appendix 

The material covered in each appendix is **not** needed for the PHY129
exam. This appendix is an "optional extra". It is meant to give you an
introduction to the ways in which you will come across techniques learnt
in this module in physics you study later, and provide additional examples
to suppoort learning of key concepts.

## Information about Stream A and Stream B (PHY129)

### Learning objectives of Stream A

Below are the learning objectives (LOs) of this module for Stream A. By the end of
the module you should be able to:

-   Use basic trigonemtric functions.

-   Differentate basic equations and understand the fundementals of differentiation.

-   Be able to use inflection to understand function shapes.

-   Use different series to approximate the behaviour of functions.

-   Integrate basic equations.

-   Solve partial differential equations.

### Learning objectives of Stream B

Below are the learning objectives (LOs) of this module for Streaam B. By the end of
the module you should be able to:

-   Add, subtract, multiply and divide complex numbers.

-   Compute powers and roots of complex numbers by the application of De
    Moivre's theorem.

-   To be able to convert between the various representations of complex
    numbers and to be aware of the definition of modulus, argument and
    conjugate of a complex number

-   Know how to manipulate matrices, vectors and scalars and their
    applications in physical problems


## Format of PHY129 

As a course PHY129 is split into two streams (A & B) and within these
streams you will have a lecture style session and a problem class
session. In the lecture We will outline the key aspects of the material
and work through some examples. These will relate to the problem class
questions for the week's session. The problem class and its associated
questions will give you the opportunity to practise the material covered
in the lecture and develop your skills tackling related mathematical
problems. These lecture notes sit alongside the lecture and problem
class. They are meant to form an overview of the material you will need
for your assessments and the wider course. Whilst there are some worked
examples within the lecture notes, the problem class is designed so that
you will develop a set of worked examples to refer to in your revision
for the exam.

### FAQ: What should I know before starting this course?

For this course you will need to remind yourself of some areas of maths
you will have previously covered. Trigonometric identities will be
required throughout the material covered in stream B. We will not
revisit this material as you will have learnt this before. We recommend
refreshing your memory in these areas before starting the course.

### FAQ: How do I ask questions about the course and material?

During the course you might have questions about the material covered in
the course. When this happens you have several options for how to ask
for help. During the session you can ask either myself or the graduate
teaching assistants for help relating to the material covered in the
lecture or in the problem class sheets. If you have a question outside
of the session you can email us (p.stowell@sheffield.ac.uk for Stream A, a.ramadan@sheffield.ac.uk for Stream B) and we will
aim to respond within 48 hours during the semester (not including
weekends) or you can book a slot in my office hours so we can go over
your problem in person. If you email during the winter holiday (late
December - early January) you will get a response when we return to work
in early January. If we think my answer to your question may be of wider
interest to other students we will share your question and the response
with all students (without any information identifying you).

### FAQ: How will I be assessed in this course?

You will have two assessed, online class tests during the semester
(Weeks 6 and 10) and an in-person exam at the end of Semester 1. We will
outline clearly before the class tests which weeks' material will be
covered in each test. The exam can cover any of the material in the
course not in the appendix. We am happy to organise a problem class prior
to the final exam if enough students are interested.
